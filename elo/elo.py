Easely rank players or teams using the Elo-rating system.
            
```python
# Example usage:
import elo
r1 = 2400 # Player r1 with rating 2400
r2 = 2000 # Player r2 with rating 2000

# New elo for player r1 after loosing to player r2
r1_prime = elo.update(r1, r2, elo.LOSS)

# New elo for player r2 after winning over player r1
r2_prime = elo.update(r2, r1, elo.WON)
```

#----- The actual score Used as input for `S(outcome)` function ------
LOSS = 0.0
TIE = 0.5
WON = 1.0

    Get the acutal score after a match has finished.

    Get the new elo based on the current rating r1, the score for the target player S1 and
    the exprected score of the target player vs another.
